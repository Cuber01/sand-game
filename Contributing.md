If you'd like to help out, please submit a pull request on [github](https://github.com/Cuber01/sand-game/pulls).

I specifically need help with making builds for other systems. I'm on Linux and can do Linux builds fine, but the Windows and Web versions still lack opengl+imgui support, which is quite bad. Ports to other systems would be great too.

Bugs/issues can be found and reported at the [issue board](https://github.com/Cuber01/sand-game/issues). You can also ask for help there.
